Sprint 1)
----------------
	o Initialize the git repository for the project "Simplified Banking App"
	o Create a low-fidelity outline of the website design. Current scope is to have 3 user facing pages:
		I. The homepage/login page
		II. The user registration page - where the user will register if their information is not currently available.
		III. The account information page - a custom message to the user, based on their DB info, will be displayed. User can choose between existing accounts and see transaction history within the accounts.
	o Functionality requirements:
		HOMEPAGE/LOGIN: At this stage, styling is kept minimal. Simple HTML effects and form elements are sufficient. Accept user login information and submit to server.
			The user will be verified using txt documents on the server. If the user exists, log in. If not, send to registration page.
		REGISTRATION: 	Styling kept minimal. HTML Form and effects is sufficient. Takes user personal data, sends to server, creates txt DB entry, and then 'initializes' the customers accounts.
			Customer is then taken to their new account page.
		ACCOUNT INFO: 	Display custom message greeting client. Display whatever accounts the customer has with the app using DB entries. Display account transactions.

Development Notes:
-------------------
	* This is TBD. Below are general notes for improvement to the platform - these tasks have yet to be scheduled.
	o Implement Bootstrap 5/CSS as necessary to improve the styling/appearance of the website.
	o Implement meaningful input restrictions/helpful error codes to inform a user of invalid input
	o Migrate Database functions from txt files to MongoDB or MySQL (still being researched).
	o Give users the ability to add an account, delete an account, make a deposit, make a withdrawal, request a loan.
